# Machine Learning Web Application using Streamlit
In here I use Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey dataset(https://survey.stackoverflow.co/datasets/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020.zip). Using Streamlit, build a web application to predict Software developers salary based on Country, Education Level and Experience. Predictions are calculated using Decision Tree Regressor.
